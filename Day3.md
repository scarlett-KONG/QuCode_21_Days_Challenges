1. Superposition

General idea: Superposition means multiple states or waves can combine into one.
Mathematical view : superposition is the linearity combination of the vectors in a vector space.
Physics view:

Wave Superposition: When waves (sound, light, water, etc.) overlap, the result is the sum of their amplitudes, which can create interference (patterns of reinforcement or cancellation).

Quantum Superposition: A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until it is measured (e.g., Schrödinger’s cat being both alive and dead).

Superposition allows systems (waves or quantum states) to interact in ways that produce new combined outcomes, not just a simple sum.

2. Wave-Particle Duality

Core idea: Light and matter can behave as both particles and waves depending on the experiment.

Examples:

Electrons: Sometimes show particle-like behavior (localized impacts), sometimes wave-like (interference patterns).
Light: Sometimes behaves as a wave (diffraction, interference), sometimes as particles (photons in the photoelectric effect).
